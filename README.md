Note from the author

This is my second next.js application and credits to the youtube channel Traversy Media for providing me and other developers with their Next.js Crash Course which gave me an in depth understanding of developing apps in next.js (having previously worked as a React.js developer i found a lot of similarities in next.js) , and Streamline for giving me the idea to create a dashboard in next.js
