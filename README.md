This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

Note from developer: batanai gwanyanya

This is my second next.js web app and credit to the youtube channel Traversy Media youtube channel for creating a Next.js Crash Course with in-depth fundumentals and other advanced concepts to help you get started with next.js and build your first project(having previously worked as a developer using React.js i found the course not too difficult to understand because of some similarities with react.js). credit to Streamline youtube channel for giving me the idea to create a dashboard in next.js using their UI design provided as an exercise to help further my understanding of next.js
